is,as
is-->is used to check type of objcet
Employee[]emplist=new Employee()
new salariedEmployee()
{empid=100,name="john"},
new contractEmployee()
{empid=101,name="john"},
};
here we are storing two different types of employee objects in Employee array
foreach(Employee emp in Emplist)
{
if(emp is salariedEMployee)
{salary=salary*10/100;

parentclass objpc=new childclass();
//cc=parentclass();
cc=parentclassobject as childclassobject
cc=(childclass)parentclassobject;
-----------------
abstract class is used as base class and we cant create object
abstarct methods will have only declaration no body
abstract methods should be implemented in child class
abstarct can contain nonabstract methods also means a method with body we can consume that nonabstarct methods with object of child class
childclassobject.nonabstarctmethodname()
abstarct class myabstarct
{
abstarct boid display();
public void display()
{
console.writeline();
}}
class childclass:myabstarct
static void()
{
childclass objc=new childclass();
objc.display();
